# Xarray-and-Multidimensional-Arrays-Workshop
Better understading of Multidimensional Arrays in Python and how Xarray package can be useful

### What is Xarray?
xarray (formerly xray) is an open source project and Python package that makes working with labelled multi-dimensional arrays simple, efficient, and fun!

Xarray introduces labels in the form of dimensions, coordinates and attributes on top of raw NumPy-like arrays, which allows for a more intuitive, more concise, and less error-prone developer experience. The package includes a large and growing library of domain-agnostic functions for advanced analytics and visualization with these data structures.
