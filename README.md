# Xarray-and-Multidimensional-Arrays-Workshop
Better understading of Multidimensional Arrays in Python and how Xarray package can be useful

### What is Xarray?
xarray (formerly xray) is an open source project and Python package that makes working with labelled multi-dimensional arrays simple, efficient, and fun!

Xarray introduces labels in the form of dimensions, coordinates and attributes on top of raw NumPy-like arrays, which allows for a more intuitive, more concise, and less error-prone developer experience. The package includes a large and growing library of domain-agnostic functions for advanced analytics and visualization with these data structures.

### Why using Xarray?
Multi-dimensional (a.k.a. N-dimensional, ND) arrays (sometimes called “tensors”) are an essential part of computational science. They are encountered in a wide range of fields, including physics, astronomy, geoscience, bioinformatics, engineering, finance, and deep learning. In Python, NumPy provides the fundamental data structure and API for working with raw ND arrays. However, real-world datasets are usually more than just raw numbers; they have labels which encode information about how the array values map to locations in space, time, etc.

Xarray doesn’t just keep track of labels on arrays – it uses them to provide a powerful and concise interface.

## The workshop

This workshop is more of a learning assignment and the material for this assignment can be found in https://geohackweek.github.io/nDarrays/.

Motivation: Geoscientist use multidimensional arrays since they commonly used sets of climate variables(e.g. temperature and precipitation) that vary in space and time and are represented on a regularly-spaced grid. However, it can be use to track other variable such movements that vary in Space and time.
